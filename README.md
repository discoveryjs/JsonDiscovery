Add the extension to your browser:

* [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/jsondiscovery/pamhglogfolfbmlpnenhpeholpnlcclo) (for Chrome & Edge, see [additional instructions](#chrome--edge))
* [Firefox Browser Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/jsondiscovery/) (see [additional instructions](#firefox))
* [Releases](https://github.com/discoveryjs/browser-extension-json-discovery/releases) section

JsonDiscovery is based on [Discovery.js](https://github.com/discoveryjs/discovery) which provides powerful features for rapid JSON analysis and beautiful reports on the fly!

## Most exciting features:

- Show JSON as an interactive tree with highlighting
- Easy an object or an array copy to clipboard
- Data structure signature (like in TypeScript)
- Data transformation with a query using Jora, suggestions on a query typing
- Customisation of JSON data presentation (using tables, lists and so on)
- Custom data presentation (a report) sharing by a link
- Works on any page with a valid JSON â€“ URL/content type doesn't matter (might not work for urls with strict CSP in some cases)
- Works on local files (see [instructions for Chromium browsers](https://github.com/discoveryjs/browser-extension-json-discovery#working-with-local-files) below)
- Works offline (doesn't perform any network requests)
